**Hello world**, this is my first Jekyll blog post. After 5 years as a software engineer, I've quit my job and am now traveling and learning. I previously had a Ruby on Rails site for my portfolio, but I'm switching to a using a Github page.

I like this page because:
* easy to make posts
* easy to link projects
* learning something new :)
