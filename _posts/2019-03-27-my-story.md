I’m a software engineer with 5+ years experience and looking to be featured at Toptal’s [Ruby on Rails](https://www.toptal.com/ruby-on-rails) and [React](https://www.toptal.com/react) developers

I’ve built out platforms for early stage startups as well as built features for large scale web applications.

Before becoming a software engineer, I studied chemical engineering and practiced as a startup and patent lawyer. While I was a lawyer, I was learning computer science on my own. I loved Harvard’s CS50 course, where I learned CS fundamentals with C and PHP. I followed that with some Ruby on Rails courses. I made some personal projects, one of which was a race results website, rungraphs.com, using Ruby on Rails, ElasticSearch, a web scraper that the NYC running community uses.

Most recently, I’ve worked at Braze, a marketing technology company, where we sell software as a service to companies to send email and push messages to their users. I built our internal tools dashboard. We use Ruby on Rails, MongoDB, Memcache. Our customer facing dashboard uses KnockoutJS (Model-View-ViewModel) and our internal dashboard uses React. We use Sidekiq and Redis for Message Queuing, JenkinsCI (one instance for running specs on any branch pushed to Github and one for deploying our application). For debugging and error tracking, we used Papertrail and Sentry. New Relic was used to identify slow endpoints and discover problems.
